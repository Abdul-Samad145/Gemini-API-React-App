# React + Vite


Gemini API React App : 


📌 About the Project: 

This project is a React-based web application where I practiced calling the Gemini API directly using axios.
The app allows users to enter a question/prompt, send it to the API, and display the response dynamically.

Key Features:

✅ Built with React + Vite

✅ API call using axios

✅ Markdown rendering with react-markdown for cleaner responses

✅ Responsive UI with simple CSS styling

✅ Loading state handling while fetching response

✅ Beginner-friendly structure for learning API integration


⚠️ Note:
The API key is not included in this repository for security reasons. You will need to add your own API key inside the Url.jsx file.



🛠️ How It Works : 

User types a prompt/question in the input field.

On clicking Send, an API request is made to the Gemini API using axios.

The app waits for the response (loading... is shown).

Once the response is received, it is displayed using ReactMarkdown.


If an error occurs, an error message is shown instead.
